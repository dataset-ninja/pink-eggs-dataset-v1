**Pink-Eggs Dataset V1** has been specifically curated for object detection tasks within the environmental industry. Comprising 1261 images, this dataset includes 2518 labeled objects falling under a singular class â€” *eggs*. The dataset presents a unique collection of images highlighting pink eggs recognized as belonging to the Pomacea canaliculata species, each accompanied by precise bounding box annotations. Its primary objective is to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, utilizing deep learning techniques to analyze and understand the distribution and proliferation of Pomacea canaliculata species. Furthermore, this dataset supports various investigative endeavors that rely on visual data pertaining to the eggs of Pomacea canaliculata, aiding studies within ecological research and environmental sciences.

## Motivation

The authors were driven by a crucial need to address the urgent ecological threat posed by the invasive apple snail species, Pomacea canaliculata. Originating from South America, the rapid global spread of this species, triggered by human activities, has resulted in detrimental impacts on wetland ecosystems, potentially endangering native species and human health. With diverse control methods under consideration, ranging from pesticides to natural predators, each with distinct risks and benefits, the authors developed the PinkEggs Dataset. This initiative focuses on utilizing the capabilities of machine learning and computer vision to effectively identify Pomacea canaliculata eggs by their distinct pink color and clustering pattern. This innovative strategy not only offers a promising solution for invasive species management but also enhances authors comprehension of the behaviors and population dynamics of such species, paving the way for more sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions. Further research in this realm holds the potential to introduce groundbreaking strategies in the ongoing battle against invasive species.

Based on the morphological characteristics of the eggs observed, as well as the presence of Pomacea canaliculata in the surrounding area, authors infer that the specimens captured in Shenzhen between October and December of 2022 during daylight hours and clear weather conditions are the eggs of Pomacea canaliculata. For close-range photography, a Redmi K50 Ultra cellular device with default camera settings was employed to capture images of the eggs. To capture distant images, a D7200 camera equipped with an 18-140mm focus range lens was utilized in auto mode. In both cases, the images were saved in the JPG format.

After detecting distortions and imperfections in the collected data, data cleansing was performed by removing certain images that did not meet predetermined quality standards. Specifically, images that could be reliably identified as depicting Pomacea canaliculata eggs were retained, while images with severe degrees of blurriness were removed. These factors could be attributed to distance, motion-induced distortion, size, and camera-specific effects. Each image in the dataset was annotated with bounding box labels using the labelImg tool by three annotators, with all annotations incorporated into the dataset to facilitate object detection and classification. In order to minimize subjectivity in the labeling process, random samples of labeled data were reviewed. Furthermore, three sets of annotations were provided to enable evaluation through methods such as cross-validation and bootstrapping. The average Intersection over Union (IoU) rate was calculated between any two sets, and all the values are above 0.87. Based on these measures, authors are highly confident that the collected images are suitable for supporting research hypotheses.

The dataset was partitioned into three distinct subsets, namely *train*, *val*, and *test* sets, each being mutually exclusive. The training set consisted of a total of 1000 images, randomly selected from the dataset, whereas the val set and test set comprised 100 and 161 images, respectively. Additionally, all images were subjected to a modification process that involved the removal of embedded camera messages while preserving the original pixel values.

In the pursuit of acquiring a comprehensive dataset, further images of Pomacea canaliculata eggs were sourced through online search engines. However, due to a dearth of explicit consent for their reuse, download, and distribution, these images could not be included in the final curation.
